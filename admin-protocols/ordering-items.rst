================================================================

Purpose
-------
To get familiarize with the process of ordering lab items.

Being a part of the lab one will have to order one or the other things, it maybe lab consumables, equipment or field items. And the procedure is slightly different for different types of items. I have tried to simplifies it as much as possible, but always check with Purchase team if you are in doubt.
Guidelines may change from time to time owing to the changes in the guidelines from Government.

Ordering generally follows the total amount of the item/items. And based on the total cost, it's divided into four categories.

 .. note:: All purchase forms are available on intranet on 172.27.1.51

1) If the total value is below 25,000/-
-------------------------------
#. This is called Local Purchase or LCP.
#. First get a quotation for the said item from a vendor. Since the total value of the indent is less than 25,000/- you need only one quotation.
#. Most commonly ordered items under this are primers, tissue rolls, labels etc.
#. Once you prepare the indent, get signature from Robin on both indent and quotation and submit for HOD approval.
#. After the HOD approval, submit to accounts section for approval.
#. Next step is to scan the indent and mail it to vendor and keep the approved indent safe as you need to submit this to process the invoice once the items are delivered.


2) If the total value is between 25,000/- and 2,50,000/-
--------------------------------------------------------
#. These type of items go under **Purchase Order** section and require purchase committee approval (Any three faculty members)
#. Get quotation from three different vendors and make sure that the particulars are exactly same on all quotation.
#. Mostly used for bulk ordering chemicals, consumables, plasticwares and equipment (like recorders, microphone etc).
#. Once the indent is filled in (order goes to least quoted vendor among three) take Robin's signature, and then purchase committee members (For ease, you can take Robin's sign again and any other two faculty) and submit for HOD approval.
#. After the HOD approval, submit to accounts section for approval. This generally takes few hours, best to go back in the evening around 5:30.
#. Next step is to enter the details in indent register in purchase section and hand over the indent to Mr Ram Shinde, who will raise the Purchase Order. That's it.
#. In this case, indent is not returned back to you.

3) If the items (mostly for consumables) are under **RATE CONTRACT (RC)**
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Rate Contract essentially means that some vendor has agreed to supply particular company items at 10% discounted rate. List of vendors and companies under RC will be with TA's.
#. If the item, one trying to procure is under RC, then irrespective of value of the indent, one has to prepare the **general indent**.
#. For this, you need only one quotation, i.e from the vendor under RC.
#. Items should be segregated based on the company and not the supplier. (Same vendor can be under RC for multiple company products, so, while ordering make sure you put together items from same company under same quotation and indent)
#. Rest is same as above, get Robin's signature --> HOD approval --> Accounts approval --> Submit to Purchase department.


4) Indenting a computer (Laptop/Desktop/Workstation)
----------------------------------------------------
#. IT department has their own indent form, which can be found on the intranet. While ordering any computer use that.
#. For Apple products, please fill in the model and specifications of the system you are planning to order.
#. For Windows/Linux system, do not mention the brand, write down only the specifications you are looking for.
#. Take your specifications to IT department and get pre-approved.
#. Get Robin's signature --> Get IT approval for indent (Mr Srikant) --> Get Dr Sudipta's approval (Physics Dept) --> HOD approval --> Accounts approval --> Hand it over to purchase dept.
#. Unlike all the other purchases, computer purchase happens over a tender.
#. Purchase will put out a call for tender and it's open for three weeks.
#. After the tender period, if there is a bidder then you will get notification from purchase department to evaluate the bid to confirm whether asking specifications and quoted specifications are a match.
#. If you are satisfied with the bidder, then Purchase Order will be released in favour of the least bidding vendor.


5) For online purchases
------------------------
#. Try to avoid purchasing from online as much as possible, but in certain cases it's not possible (ex: batteries, memory cards etc).
#. In such cases, before ordering from online, take HOD approval (Format is available with Robin) with each item cost and particulars.
#. Try to keep the overall value below than 20,000/- to avoid unnecessary questions.
#. After taking pre-approval from HOD, either Robin, or one self can order.
#. No need to submit Test Report (Explained below), and invoice can be submitted for reimbursements directly (See Bill Submission guidelines)



What to do once you receive the item?
-------------------------------------

#. For all the items, irrespective of its kind, one needs to prepare **Test Report**
#. Test report is an acknowledgement that we have received the said items in correct condition without any damage.
#. There are two types of Test Reports a) For Consumables b) For non-consumables. Make sure to use the correct one. TR is available from intranet (172.27.1.51)
#. If the item/s are damaged or not in the condition the way it was supposed to be, then intimate the purchase department immediately and with relevant proof contact the supplier over email.
