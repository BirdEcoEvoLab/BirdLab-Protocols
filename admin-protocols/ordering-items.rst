Purpose
-------
To get familiarize with the process of ordering lab items.

Being a part of the lab one will have to order one or the other things, it maybe lab consumables, equipment or field items. And the procedure is slightly different for each type. I have tried to simplifies it as much as possible, but always check with Purchase team if you are in doubt.
Guidelines may change from time to time owing to the changes in the guidelines from Government.

Ordering generally follows the total amount of the item/items. And based on the total cost, it's divided into two categories.

1) If the amount is below 25000
-------------------------------
#. This is called Local Purchase or LCP.
#. First get a quotation for the said item from a vendor
