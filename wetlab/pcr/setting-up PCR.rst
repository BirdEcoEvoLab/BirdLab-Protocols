Purpose
-------
Perform Polymerase Chain Reaction to amplify a fragment of a targeted gene

Steps
-----
#. Prepare the working solution of your target primers.
#. Stock primers are ordered at a concentration of 100mMol and 25ng.
#. General practice is to prepare 5mMol primers pair from the stock solution. (Add 5ul of Forward and 5ul of Reverse primers to 90ul of Nucleus Free water to obtain a final 5mMol concentration)
#. Following are the general composition and constituents to set up a PCR reaction.

+----------------------+----------+
| Constituents         | For 1x   |
+======================+==========+
| DNA                  | 2ul      |
+----------------------+----------+
| Master Mix(MM)       | 5ul      |
+----------------------+----------+
| Primers (F+R)        | 1ul      |
+----------------------+----------+
| Nucleus Free Water   | 2ul      |
+----------------------+----------+
| Total                | 10ul     |
+----------------------+----------+

NOTE: For Sanger's sequencing, Medauxin and Aggrigenome asks for a total of 20ul final reaction volume; modify accordingly.

#. Make sure to UV the pipettes, tips and strip tubes before you start setting up the PCR.
#. We have two PCR machines (Eppendorf) in the lab, use one of them to run your reactions.
#. While setting up for the first time; create a new user with your name and save the desired programme.
#. Book the machine slots by using the QR code available next to PCR machine.
#. Typical programme runs for about 2 to 2.5 hours, but varies depends on the number of cycles.
#. Once the programme finishes running, visualize the PCR product by running on 1.5% agarose gel to confirm the amplicon size and success of PCR. (Refer next section "Gel" for further details)
#. Clean the pipettes and your work bench after you finished working.
