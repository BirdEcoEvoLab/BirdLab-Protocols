Includes various miscellaneous details
--------------------------------------
#. Wet lab space is divided into four sections. a) Extraction area. b) PCR bench. c) NGS Bench and QC. d) Gel area.
#. Each section have their own set of pipettes and discards. Make sure to use them and not interchange.
#. Institute has a common autoclave facility, and house keeping staff set up the cycle everyday (except on Saturdays and Sundays).
#. Make sure to wrap the items which needs to be autoclaved in Aluminium foil and keep them in the autoclave room before 10AM (This is the guideline at the time of preparation of this document, make sure to update and/or talk to people for future guidelines)
#. All items (glassware, plasticware, trays, instruments, pipettes, ... everything)  in the lab, should be labeled as “BirdLab / VVR”.
#. Every time a new item (reagents, chemicals, buffers, tip boxes, tube packets, plates etc…) is opened the user should mention the date on the item.
#. For buffer and reagents date of preparation, opening and  initials of the person preparing should be mentioned.
#. Each person should have their own tip boxes separately (labelled by the person’s name/initials) for extraction area, pcr setup and gel area. These tip boxes should not be moved around workbenches.
#. Every fridge has designated shelves for separate items (samples, extracts, reagents etc). Maintain this segregation and never put two different category items together in one shelf.
#. We have two type of discards, solid and liquid. Solid wastes are accumulated in red biohazard bag and autoclaved before discarding.
#. Every Saturdays there will be a discard autoclave cycle. So when the bag is full keep the biohazard bag/s in autoclave room before 10AM on Saturday.
#. Liquid wastes are generally taken care by chemistry department, when the container is full hand them over to chemistry TA.
#. Clean the workbench, pipettes with 10% bleach and 70% ethanol before and after your work.
#. Use seperate discard dustbin for disposal of used gloves.
#. Under no condition shall the gels, organic and inorganic solvents, buffers should be discarded in the sink.
