Quality Check for the extrcated DNA, quantifying NGS libraries.
===============================================================

Purpose
-------
To quantify the concentration of extracted DNA and NGS libraries.

Two methods of quantification

#. Nanodrop
------------
We do not have this in our lab, but if required, use the ones in Ram's lab (Nanophoto meter) or the one in Ashwani Sharma's lab at Chemistry department.

Steps
-----
#. Wash the NanoDrop pedestal with distilled water and use only KimWipes to clean the lower pedestal.
#. Set the blank using 2ul of the solution DNA is suspended in. This is usually buffer AE (Kit method of extraction) or TE (PCI method of extraction).
#. Make sure to wipe both the pedestals vigorously to clean.
#. Add 2ul of your sample to the lower pedestal and then lower the upper arm.
#. After ~15 seconds, readings will be displayed, make sure to note down concentration, A260/280, A230/260 ratio.
#. Clean both the pedestals with water and wipe it clean with KimWipes.



#.. Qubit

Qubit is the preferred method of DNA quantification due to its sensitivity.
