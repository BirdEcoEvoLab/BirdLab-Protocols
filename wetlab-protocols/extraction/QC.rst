Purpose
-------
To quantify the concentration of extracted DNA and NGS libraries.

Two methods of quantification

Nanodrop
------------
We do not have this in our lab, but if required, use the ones in Ram's lab (Nanophoto meter) or the one in Ashwani Sharma's lab at Chemistry department.

Steps
-----
#. Wash the NanoDrop pedestal with distilled water and use only KimWipes to clean the lower pedestal.
#. Set the blank using 2ul of the solution DNA is suspended in. This is usually buffer AE (Kit method of extraction) or TE (PCI method of extraction).
#. Make sure to wipe both the pedestals vigorously to clean.
#. Add 2ul of your sample to the lower pedestal and then lower the upper arm.
#. After ~15 seconds, readings will be displayed, make sure to note down concentration, A260/280, A230/260 ratio.
#. Clean both the pedestals with water and wipe it clean with KimWipes.



Qubit
-----

Qubit is the preferred method of DNA quantification due to its sensitivity.

#. Take out the working solution from fridge and let it sit at room temperature for ~15 minutes.
#. Turn on the Qubit machine and select DNA -> 1X HS High sensitivity option.
#. Check the last date of calibration. If the last calibration is older than a week, make sure to calibre the machine with Standards.
#. To calibre, add 190ul of working solution and 10ul of Standard '#1' and Standard '#2' and vortex for 15 seconds. Incubate the tubes at room temperature for about 2 minutes.
#. Once calibrated, add 198ul of working solution to each Qubit tubes per sample and 2ul of sample and vortex. Incubate for 2 minutes.
#. Note down the concentration readings and discard the tubes.
