==============================

-------------------------------

This protocol is slightly modified from Qiagen Blood and Tissue kit protocol

Before you begin the extraction, make sure Molecular grade ethanol (100%) is kept in -20C and remove PBS from fridge to thaw (It takes time!!) Once you ready, get started.

Clean your work bench with bleach and alcohol, UV the Pipettes, Tips and MCTs.
Now you are ready to begin.

--------------------------------

#. Pipet 30 µl Proteinase K into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 150ul of Blood Buffer. Adjust the volume to 220 µl with PBS
#. Add 200 µl Buffer AL. Mix thoroughly by vortexing, and incubate at 56°C for 60-90 minutes.
#. Add 200 µl chilled ethanol (100%) to the sample, and mix thoroughly by vortexing. It is important that the sample and the ethanol are mixed thoroughly to yield a homogeneous solution.
#. Pipet the mixture from step 3 into the DNeasy Mini spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tube. Centrifuge at 8000 rpm for 1 min. Discard flowthrough and collection tube.
#. Place the DNeasy Mini spin column in a new 2 ml collection tube, add 500 µl Buffer AW1, and centrifuge for 1 min at 8000 rpm. Discard flow-through and collection tube.
#. Place the DNeasy Mini spin column in a new 2 ml collection tube, add 500 µl Buffer AW2, and centrifuge for 3 min at 14,000 rpm to dry the DNeasy membrane. Discard flow-through and collection tube.
#. Place the DNeasy Mini spin column in a clean 1.5 ml  microcentrifuge tube , and pipet 100 µl Buffer AE directly onto the DNeasy membrane. Incubate at room temperature for 1min, and then centrifuge for 1 min at 8000 rpm to elute.
#. Repeat the above step for second elute.
#. Store the eluted DNA in -20C

Clean the workbench, pipettes and UV the tips and MCTs.
